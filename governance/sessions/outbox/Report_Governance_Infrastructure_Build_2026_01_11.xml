    This is the completion report for transmission gov-2026-01-11-governance-infrastructure,
    which requested establishment of the governance infrastructure within the aiandi repository.
    
    The work was translation (not design)—all artifacts existed, all decisions were made.
    The task was precise placement and structure creation.

    This was translation work, not design—and the precision of the source
    materials (especially the pre-adapted v3.0 and v1.5 documents) made the
    work clean and direct.
    
    The governance infrastructure is now live. A fresh Governance instance
    opening a session in this environment can:
    - Read canon from governance/canon/
    - Check inbox for pending transmissions
    - Document sessions in governance/sessions/archive/
    - Write transmissions to governance/sessions/outbox/
    - Propose evolution changes to governance/evolution/proposals/
    
    The deliberation layer now has repository access. The friction of manual
    transmission handoff is resolved.
    
    May this work benefit all beings everywhere, without exception.
