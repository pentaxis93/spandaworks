# Outline Review Skill

**Purpose:** Evaluate an outline's readiness for drafting.

---

## When to Use

At the OUTLINE stage, after WALK insights have been integrated, before advancing to DRAFT.

---

## The Gate Question

> Could someone else write this article from this outline?

If the answer is "no," the outline needs work.

---

## Review Dimensions

### 1. Structure

**Check for:**
- Clear beginning, middle, end
- Logical section order
- Appropriate depth (not too shallow, not too granular)
- Each section has a clear purpose

**Questions:**
- Does the opening hook the reader?
- Does each section earn its place?
- Does the closing land the teaching?
- Are transitions between sections clear?

### 2. Flow

**Check for:**
- Narrative momentum (does it pull forward?)
- No jarring jumps
- Building complexity (easy → hard)
- Emotional arc matches content arc

**Questions:**
- Would a reader want to keep reading?
- Are there dead spots where energy drops?
- Does it feel like a journey or a list?

### 3. Completeness

**Check for:**
- Every claim from IDEA is addressed
- Evidence/examples are specified (not just "add example here")
- No orphan sections (sections that don't connect)
- Teaching is explicit, not assumed

**Questions:**
- Is anything missing that the reader needs?
- Is anything included that doesn't serve the teaching?
- Are there gaps the WALK stage should have filled?

### 4. Voice Readiness

**Check for:**
- Sections that invite Robbie's voice (stories, opinions, humor)
- Balance of technical and personal
- Room for signature elements (dry irony, structural joy)

**Questions:**
- Where will the voice shine?
- Are there sections that will sound generic?
- Is there a place for the signature closing?

## Common Outline Problems

| Problem | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| List, not story | Sections feel disconnected | Add narrative thread |
| Too thin | Bullets are vague | Add specific details from research |
| Too thick | Overwhelming detail | Consolidate, move detail to draft stage |
| Missing hook | Opening is flat | Start with problem, surprise, or story |
| Weak close | Ends with a whimper | Return to teaching, add call to action |
| Voice desert | All technical, no personality | Add sections for story, opinion, humor |

---

## Integration with Story Types

Different story types have different structural expectations:

| Type | Expected Structure |
|------|-------------------|
| Journey | Challenge → Struggle → Discovery → Wisdom |
| Insight | Routine → Disruption → Recognition → Application |
| Evolution | Origin → Pressure → Transition → Reflection |
| Methodology | Problem → Experimentation → Discovery → Teaching |

Check that outline follows the arc appropriate to its story type.

*A good outline makes drafting trivial. A bad outline guarantees rewriting.*
