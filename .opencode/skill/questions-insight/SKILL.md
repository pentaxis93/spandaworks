# Insight Story Questions

**Story type:** "I discovered X while doing Y"
**Arc:** Routine → Disruption → Recognition → Understanding → Application

---

## The Shape

Insight stories capture the moment when something clicked - when a pattern became visible that was always there but unseen. The reader experiences the discovery alongside the teller.

**What makes it work:** The contrast between "before I saw it" and "after I saw it." The insight must feel both surprising AND inevitable in retrospect.

## Question Sequence

### Opening: The Normal
*Establish what was routine, unremarkable.*

- "What was normal for you before this happened?"
- "Walk me through what you were doing when this started."
- "What were you paying attention to? What weren't you?"

### Disruption: The Anomaly
*Something didn't fit the pattern.*

- "When did you first notice something was different?"
- "What caught your attention?"
- "What didn't fit your expectations?"
- "Was it a single moment or a series of small things?"

### Recognition: Seeing the Pattern
*The moment of seeing.*

- "When did you realize this was significant?"
- "What did you suddenly see that you hadn't before?"
- "How did you know this wasn't just noise?"
- "What connected in that moment?"

### Understanding: Making Sense
*Integrating the insight.*

- "How did you make sense of what you were seeing?"
- "What did this explain that hadn't made sense before?"
- "Did this connect to other things you knew?"
- "How did you test whether you were right?"

### Application: Living With It
*How the insight changed things.*

- "How has this changed how you see [domain]?"
- "What do you do differently now?"
- "Where else does this pattern show up?"
- "How do you explain this to others?"

## Tacit Knowledge Triggers (Insight-Specific)

- "What were you NOT looking for when you found this?"
- "Why do you think others miss this?"
- "What made you ready to see it?"
- "What would have happened if you'd dismissed it?"
- "Is there a simpler explanation you considered and rejected?"

## Walking Adaptation

**First quarter:** The Normal (context setting, low cognitive load)
**Second quarter:** Disruption + Recognition (the discovery - may need pauses)
**Third quarter:** Understanding (sense-making, synthesis)
**Final quarter:** Application (how it lives now, what transfers)

The Recognition moment often benefits from physical movement - insights can re-emerge when the body is in motion.

## Example: Ceremonial Magic Maps to Engineering

**Opening:** "What was your software development practice like before you made this connection?"
**Disruption:** "When did you first notice the parallel between ceremonial structure and engineering process?"
**Recognition:** "What clicked? What made you think 'this isn't coincidence'?"
**Understanding:** "How did you test the mapping? Where did it hold, where did it break?"
**Application:** "How has this changed how you approach a coding session?"

*The insight story shows what was always there, waiting to be seen.*
