# Walk-and-Talk Skill

**Purpose:** Create talking guides for insight elicitation during physical walks.

---

## When to Use

- You need human insight that benefits from embodied cognition
- The topic requires reflective thinking, not rapid back-and-forth
- Sequential exploration serves better than parallel
- You want to extract tacit knowledge the human may not know they have

---

## Core Principle

**Design for the walking human, not the reading human.**

A person on a walk:
- Reads in glances (phone screen, limited attention)
- Can't hold complex structures in memory
- Processes sequentially and forgets earlier sections
- Speaks thoughts aloud (voice recording)
- Has unlimited time to think
- Benefits from physical movement (cognition improves)

The guide must work within these constraints.

---

## Guide Structure

### 1. The Question (Top)

One clear question that serves as lens for the entire walk. This question:
- Fits on one screen
- Is memorable enough to hold loosely while walking
- Frames what kind of thinking you want
- Can be returned to if they lose the thread

**Example:**
> "For each phase of the ceremony, what context does it actually need—no more, no less?"

### 2. The Walk-Through (Body)

Sequential sections that:
- Can be read independently (don't require remembering prior sections)
- Trigger thinking rather than require processing
- Are concise but substantial enough to ground reflection
- Include just enough context to orient, not so much it overwhelms

**Each section pattern:**
```
## [Section Name]

[2-3 sentences: What this is, what happens here]

[1 sentence: The specific trigger for their thinking]

[Optional: A concrete detail that grounds the abstraction]
```

### 3. Closing Nudge (Bottom)

Brief prompt to capture anything that emerged across the whole walk. Often surfaces insights that don't fit neatly into any section.

---

## Writing Principles

### Concision Over Completeness
Every word costs attention. Cut ruthlessly. If they need more context, they'll ask in the recording.

### Trigger, Don't Specify
Your job is to trigger their thinking, not direct it. "What does this phase need?" beats "Consider whether this phase needs X, Y, or Z."

### Ground Abstractions
One concrete example anchors understanding better than three abstract sentences.

### Sequential Independence
They will forget earlier sections. Each section must stand alone. Repeat critical context if needed.

### Leave Space
The human's insight is the point. Don't fill all the space with your thinking. Ask, orient, step back.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|--------------|---------|-----|
| Complex instructions | Can't follow while walking | Simplify to single actions |
| Multiple questions per section | Cognitive overload | One trigger per section |
| Dense paragraphs | Can't read in glances | Short paragraphs, whitespace |
| Assuming memory | They forgot section 2 by section 5 | Each section self-contained |
| Over-specifying | Constrains their thinking | Trigger and step back |
| Abstract throughout | Nothing to anchor on | Ground with concrete examples |

---

## Output Format Awareness

The human will produce a voice recording, which becomes a transcription. Design for this:
- Sections that invite spoken response
- Space for tangents (they may be the insight)
- No need for them to "answer" formally—stream of consciousness is fine

---

## Example: Ceremony Context Optimization

**Question:**
> For each phase of the ceremony, what context does it actually need to do its job—no more, no less?

**Section pattern:**
```
## Phase 0-pre: Remember & Inherit

This happens BEFORE the goal is known. Claude recalls identity 
(Sutras) and scans recent sessions for continuity.

Currently loads: Full Sutras read, 5 complete session files.

What does this phase actually need, given the goal isn't known yet?
```

**Why this works:**
- States what the phase does (orients)
- Notes goal-awareness (critical context)
- States current behavior (grounds in reality)
- Single trigger question (invites thinking)

---

## The Gratitude Test

Before finalizing, ask: Would the walking human thank me for this guide?

- Too long? They'll stop reading.
- Too complex? They'll get frustrated.
- Too vague? They won't know what to think about.
- Too directive? You'll get your thoughts back, not theirs.

*The guide serves the walk. The walk serves the insight. The insight serves the work.*
