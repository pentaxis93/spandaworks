# The Art: Tarot XIV / Temperance
## Version 2.0 - Architecturally Aligned Synthesis

> *The angel mixes fire and water into a third thing.*

## Architectural Reality

**Critical:** LLMs generate **autogressively** (token-by-token, left-to-right). 
- Bullet-point outlines → sequential expansion (path of least resistance)
- Synthesis guidance → transformation (synthesis)
- Sol must be thematic guidance, NOT bullet structure

## Sol Format

**WRONG (causes failure):**
```markdown
## Opening Hook
- Bullet 1
- Bullet 2
```

**RIGHT (enables synthesis):**
```markdown
## Opening Movement: The Seed
Thematic guidance: what this does, how it feels, narrative intent.
Evidence library to draw from, not template to fill.
Heading for draft: (none - first section)

## Second Movement: The Gap
Thematic guidance for second section.
Heading for draft: "The Gap"
```

## The Protocol

### Phase 1: Gather Elements
- Load Sol (synthesis-prep.md with thematic guidance)
- Load Luna (voice skill)
- Verify Sol is NOT bullet-point format

### Phase 2: Synthesis via Guided Generation
- Internalize whole (all Sol guidance + Luna patterns)
- Generate from coherence (not expanding bullets)
- Reference Sol as evidence library
- Let Luna govern rhythm and flow
- Use section headings from Sol (first section gets no heading; subsequent sections use ## headings)

### Phase 3: Proportion Check
- Sol grounded? Luna aligned?
- **Staccato check:** Mechanical (FAIL) or organic rhythm?
- **Structure check:** Following Sol bullets (FAIL) or synthesized?

### Phase 4: Output to seeds/

*Metaphor remains. Method evolves.*
