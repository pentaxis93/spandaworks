# Synthesis Prep Skill

**Purpose:** Create Sol (synthesis guidance) for the-art.

**NOT an outline.** Outlines → sequential expansion. Synthesis prep → transformation.

## Format

Each section contains:

### [Section Title]: [Descriptive Movement Name]

**What this section does:** [One sentence purpose]

**How it should feel:** [Tone, rhythm, emotional register]

**Key material:**
- [Evidence, quotes, facts - as library, NOT bullets to expand]

**Narrative intent:** [What this accomplishes in story arc]

**Voice opportunity:** [Where authentic voice shines]

**Evidence:** [Sources with timestamps/references]

## Anti-Pattern: Bullet Lists

**WRONG:**
```markdown
## Opening Hook
- Childhood memory
- Terminal commands  
- Fascination
```

This invites: "Childhood memory. Terminal commands. Fascination." (mechanical expansion)

**RIGHT:**
```markdown
## Opening Movement: The Seed

**What this does:** Establishes emotional foundation

**How it feels:** Sensory, immediate, not nostalgic

**Key material:** Best friend's dad at terminal, "magical invocations" phrase (load-bearing), walk quote timestamp 3:42

**Narrative intent:** Plant seed without resolving

**Voice opportunity:** Demonstration-before-naming
```

This enables synthesis.

## Quality Gate

Before handing to the-art:
- [ ] NO bullet-point structure
- [ ] Each section has thematic guidance
- [ ] Evidence is library (not template)
- [ ] Tone/feel specified
- [ ] Narrative intent clear

*Get Sol right, synthesis becomes inevitable.*
