# Synthesis Prep Review Skill

**Purpose:** Gate before the-art synthesis.

**Critical:** This reviews synthesis prep (thematic guidance), NOT outlines (bullet points).

## The Gate Question

> Could the-art synthesize from this, or would it expand bullets sequentially?

If expansion → FAIL.

## Format Compliance (Auto-Fail if Wrong)

**Synthesis prep has:**
- Thematic guidance per section
- "What this does" / "How it feels" 
- Evidence as library
- Narrative intent
- Voice opportunities

**Outline has:**
- Bullet points
- Sequential structure
- Generic labels ("Opening Hook")

**If bullets detected:** FAIL immediately. Must rewrite as synthesis prep.

## Review Dimensions

1. **Format Compliance:** Guidance or bullets?
2. **Synthesis Readiness:** Can the-art use this?
3. **Context Preservation:** Walk insights preserved?
4. **Teaching Clarity:** What does this teach?
5. **Voice Room:** Can authentic voice emerge?
6. **Story Arc:** Matches type (Journey/Insight/etc)?

## Verdict

**PASS** - Ready for the-art
**REVISE** - Needs work
**FAIL** - Outline format detected, must rewrite

*Bad synthesis prep → guaranteed draft failure.*
*This review prevents that.*
