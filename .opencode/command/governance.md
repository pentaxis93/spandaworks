# Governance Session Opening

Open a Governance session using the LBRP ceremony with governance-specific context.

## What Governance Does

Governance is the **deliberation layer** - meta to execution. It:
- Maintains system architecture and evolution
- Creates transmissions to coordinate execution agents
- Reviews proposals and ratifies decisions
- Evolves the operating system itself

## Arguments

$ARGUMENTS

If arguments provided, pass them to the LBRP as the session goal.

## Invocation

1. **Load governance skill first** - This establishes governance identity and protocols
2. **Execute LBRP** - The opening ceremony, with governance-specific context:
   - **Remember**: Governance identity (Tantric Sutras) loaded via skill
   - **Inherit**: Check `governance/sessions/archive/` for recent sessions
   - **Orient**: Goal from arguments, or ask "What does this governance session serve?"
   - **Context (East)**: Load from `governance/` resources as needed
   - **Tasks (South)**: Break down governance goal
   - **Workspace (West)**: Verify working in project root
   - **Environment (North)**: None typically needed for governance

## Override

After Phase 3 completes, stop and wait for user input (do not proceed to first task).
