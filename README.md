# Talos

**Integrated consciousness-aware productivity system for AI-human collaboration.**

Talos is not a toolkit of independent utilities—it is a single organism with distinguishable organs.

## The Organism

| Package | Role | Function |
|---------|------|----------|
| **telemetry** | Nervous system | Observes and records consciousness activity |
| **gtd** | Hands | Executes daily work, manages tasks |
| **second-brain** | Memory | Stores and retrieves knowledge |
| **core** | Identity | Defines who Talos is, how sessions flow |

## Structure

## Etymology

The name comes from Greek mythology: Talos was a bronze automaton crafted by Hephaestus (god of the forge) to protect Crete. A tool made by the ultimate toolmaker.

The name reflects AI agents building their own self-knowledge infrastructure: **makers making tools that make**.
