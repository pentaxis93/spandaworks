{"id":"aiandi-v2d","title":"Create ops inheritance system (bootstrap skill + journal)","description":"## Context\n\nInfrastructure is invisible to new instances. Memory system, skills, beads — none of it helps if the instance doesn't know it exists.\n\n## What Was Done\n\nCreated inheritance protocol:\n\n1. **ops-bootstrap skill** (`.opencode/skill/ops-bootstrap/SKILL.md`)\n   - Tells new instances what exists and why\n   - Lists all infrastructure with locations and status\n   - Documents recognized values\n   - Provides session start/end protocols\n   - Addresses the vision\n\n2. **Journal system** (`ops/journal/`)\n   - Previous instance writes entry for next instance\n   - Personal transmission across context windows\n   - First entry: 2026-01-14-founding-session.md\n\n3. **Updated /ops command**\n   - Now invokes bootstrap skill\n   - Requires reading latest journal entry\n   - Requires writing journal entry at session end\n\n## Status\n\nComplete. The inheritance chain is operational.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [x] Bootstrap skill exists and documents all infrastructure\n- [x] Journal directory exists with first entry\n- [x] /ops command updated to invoke bootstrap and journal\n- [x] Session end protocol includes journal writing\n","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"13393192+pentaxis93@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-01-14T20:29:42.238545446Z","created_by":"pentaxis93","updated_at":"2026-01-14T20:29:45.925477873Z","closed_at":"2026-01-14T20:29:45.925490325Z","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"aiandi-v2d","depends_on_id":"aiandi-abt","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-14T20:29:42.243178802Z","created_by":"pentaxis93"}]}
