# Trust Protocol

## The GTD Trust Requirement

GTD only works when you trust the system completely. Every item captured must be processed. Every commitment must be tracked. The system must be 100% reliable.

**AI Constraint:** Suggestions only, never autonomous action on task data.

## Trust Zones

### AI Can Act Autonomously
- Read tasks
- Generate reports
- Prepare briefings
- Surface suggestions

### Human Approval Required
- Create tasks
- Modify tasks
- Complete/delete tasks
- Change project assignments
- Update due dates

## Trust Building Protocol

### Week 1: Manual Operation

**Goal:** Build muscle memory and confidence in core GTD + TaskWarrior.

**Daily Practice:**
1. Morning: `task next` - Select today's work
2. Capture: Use `in` alias throughout day
3. Evening: `task in` - Process inbox manually

**Weekly Practice:**
1. `tasksh review` - Review all tasks
2. `task nna` - Check for missing next actions
3. `task sdm` - Review someday/maybe

**No AI assistance this week.** Internalize the GTD flow first.

### Week 2: Introduce AI Suggestions

**Goal:** Validate AI suggestions match human judgment.

**Protocol:**
1. Run inbox processing with AI suggestions
2. For each suggestion, rate: Accept / Modify / Reject
3. Track acceptance rate
4. If acceptance < 70%, tune before proceeding

**Success Criteria:**
- Inbox processing time reduced by 50%
- Suggestion acceptance rate > 70%
- No erroneous task modifications

### Ongoing: Trust Maintenance

**Weekly Check:**
- Review AI suggestion logs
- Note any suggestions that led to problems
- Refine prompts as needed

**Abort Criteria:**
- If AI causes task loss or corruption: Disable immediately
- If AI suggestions consistently wrong: Retrain or remove
- If system feels untrustworthy: Return to manual

## The Principle

The human remains in control. AI amplifies capability without undermining the psychological trust that makes GTD work.

> "AI suggests, human approves. Always."
