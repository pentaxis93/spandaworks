# GTD

**The hands** - executes daily work, manages tasks.

## Purpose

AI-augmented GTD system with trust model: AI suggests, human approves.

## Components

- **MCP Server:** 22 tools for complete GTD workflow
- **TaskWarrior Config:** UDAs for GTD fields (context, energy, etc.)
- **Workflow Tools:** process_inbox, get_next_actions, weekly_review, project_status

## Boundaries

- Manages tasks and projects, does not store long-term knowledge
- Processes inbox, does not synthesize patterns
- Operates in GTD context, not session context

## Language

TypeScript (MCP server)
