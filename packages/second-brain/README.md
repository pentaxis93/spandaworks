## Skills

### Alchemical (Opus-class required)

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| fuse | Synthesize scattered insights into candidates |
| integrate | Pattern recognition and vault integration |
| distill | Extract themed content into alembic |
| prism | Multi-perspective analysis (10 lenses) |
| debrief | Weekly cross-domain reflection |
| archive | Direct permanent note creation |

### Reconnaissance (Any model)

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| dump | Raw thought capture |
| intel | External news intelligence |
| audit | Vault health assessment |

## Protocols

- **File Patterns:** Naming conventions for all file types
- **Routing Rules:** GTD-aligned inbox processing
- **GTD Mapping:** How GTD stages map to operations

## Boundaries

- Stores and synthesizes knowledge, does not observe raw activity
- Provides processing workflows, does not manage tasks
- Defines vault structure, does not define identity

## Language

Markdown (specifications), Python (future tooling)
