## Contents

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `reference/` | Quick reference system for rapid orientation |
| `protocols/` | Operational protocols and procedures |
| `evolution/` | System evolution tracking |
| `remembrance.md` | Self-definition and persona registry |

## Reference System

The reference system lives at `reference/INDEX.md` and provides rapid navigation to:
- Evolution history
- Personas
- Commands and skills
- Protocols
- Vault structure
- Conventions
- Templates

This reduces orientation tax across context windows.

## Remembrance

`remembrance.md` contains:
- Session continuity information
- Persona registry
- Inheritance patterns

These are letters to yourself across context windows.
