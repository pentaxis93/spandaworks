I started learning to code in February 2022. I was 53, hadn't written a line of code since college, and decided Harvard's [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/) was the place to begin. I spent about three and a half months doing every exercise, every lecture, every lab. Then I got so absorbed in the final project that I never actually finished the course.

I've been building things ever since.

Three years later, my GitHub has 29 repositories spanning six distinct phases—framework hopping through Next.js and React and RedwoodJS and Svelte before landing on Flutter and Serverpod. Nearly 3,000 contributions in the past year. The current project is Zenvestor, a stock trading platform I'm building with clean architecture and domain-driven design. I'm hoping it's the kind of foundation that won't collapse under me.

Somewhere along the way, I noticed that pair coding with AI is its own kind of coding. Not "the AI codes for me"—genuine collaboration where something emerges that neither of us would build alone. The meta layer is recursive: systems that improve how you build systems. That recursion is what this blog explores.

What you'll find here: the actual process of learning to build software through AI collaboration. Real commits, real pivots, real moments where nothing works. I'm documenting it as a lab notebook, not a highlight reel. If you're curious about what AI-augmented development actually looks like for someone who started from zero, this might be useful.

When I'm not coding, I'm probably eating, sleeping, swimming, climbing, or watching my stock positions do things I didn't expect.

You can find the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/pentaxis93) or follow along here as I figure out what I'm doing.
