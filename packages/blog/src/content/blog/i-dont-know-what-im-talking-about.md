I'm 55 years old. I'm building a stock trading platform in Dart. And I don't know how to code.

For two years, I fought the syntax. Every tutorial was a trap; every package manager a labyrinth. I could build the "Hello World," but the moment I tried to connect a database to a UI, the complexity crushed me. The learning curve didn't flatten; it just reset.

Then the tools changed.

Claude Code didn't just speed things up. It changed what "learning to code" means. Suddenly, the syntax wasn't the job anymore. The job was the *structure*.

The AI handles the implementation—the mechanics, the boilerplate, the "how." I handle the architecture—the design decisions, the systems thinking, the "what" and the "why."

I'm not writing loops. I'm designing systems. And it turns out, I know how to design systems. I've been doing it my whole life, just not in code.

## Writing Is Thinking

This website isn't here to teach you anything. It's to teach *me*.

My high school physics teacher, Mr. Horton, used to say: "If you're not writing, you're not thinking."

He was right. When I explain something, I start to see the gaps in my understanding. My fuzzy thinking gets exposed. Then I can try to fix it.

This blog isn't documenting stuff I've already figured out—it's *figuring stuff out through writing*. When I try to explain why an architectural choice makes sense or how a particular method works, the patterns become clearer to me.

The blog is my thinking tool. You're invited to watch me think.

## What You'll Find Here

This is the log of a 55-year-old beginner building production software with an alien intelligence.

You'll see:
- **Actual code** - Zenvestor (six figures of code and counting), where the rubber meets the road.
- **Architecture decisions** - Why I chose specific patterns, what worked, and what failed spectacularly.
- **AI collaboration** - How I work with the machine. Where it shines, and where human mentation is non-negotiable.
- **The struggles** - The authentic, messy learning process.

You won't find:
- **Expert advice** - I'm not qualified to give it.
- **Best practices** - I don't know them.
- **Polished retrospectives** - The messy middle is where I discover my assumptions were wrong.

## Foundation First

I learned to work foundation-first in other contexts. Start with basics, practice them until they feel solid, build up from there. The same laws apply here.

In code, that means:
- Write tests before features.
- Refactor as understanding deepens.
- Don't jump to advanced techniques before the fundamentals make sense.

It works because it was never magic to begin with. It's just structure.

This might seem slow. It is slow. But it's how I build things that don't collapse under their own weight.

This is either profound or hilarious. Probably both.
