# Walking Guide: 56, Beginner

**The question for this walk:**

> When did you first recognize that you'd been doing systems thinking your whole career—and what did that recognition feel like?

---

## Before Code

You have a philosophy/engineering-physics degree. You joined EDS doing data modeling and business process design. Then McKinsey, treating business problems as systems.

**What was "systems thinking" to you back then? Did it have a name, or was it just how you worked?**

---

## The Syntax Wall

2022-2024. Tutorials, package managers, the learning curve that kept resetting.

**Take me back to a specific moment when the complexity crushed you. What were you trying to build? What broke?**

---

## The Shift

AI tools arrive. Suddenly syntax isn't the job anymore.

**When did you first notice that the *structure* was familiar? That you'd done this before, just not in code?**

Was it sudden or gradual? A specific moment, or a dawning?

---

## The Recognition

"I've been designing systems my whole life, just not in code."

**What did that recognition feel like? Relief? Vindication? Something else?**

What connects EDS data modeling to Zenvestor architecture? What's the through-line?

---

## Beginner's Mind

160,000 lines of production code. You still feel like a beginner most days.

**What does "beginner" mean to you now that it didn't mean before?**

Some days it's a problem. Some days it's the point. **What's the difference between those days?**

---

## The Transfer

McKinsey, Kellogg, decades of practice. "Foundation first."

**What's a specific moment when you realized your non-code experience was directly applicable?**

What did you bring from that past life that surprises you now?

---

## Closing

**What haven't I asked that matters for this story?**

Anything that came up during the walk that doesn't fit the sections above.

*Record your thoughts. Tangents welcome. The texture is the point.*
