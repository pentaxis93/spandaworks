## Spiritual-Coding Connection

**The sequence matters:**
1. Decades of spiritual practice
2. Aka Dua weekly discipline (2020-2021)
3. CS50 / coding journey begins (2022)
4. Meta-level AI collaboration work (2025)

**Interpretation:**
- The contemplative foundation enables the learning journey
- Beginner's mind cultivated through practice
- "Foundation first" philosophy has spiritual roots
- Systematic approach to learning mirrors systematic spiritual practice

---

## Practice Integration Today

**Visible in current work:**
- Buddhist philosophy woven into project documentation
- Closing rituals in coding sessions
- "Serve all beings" orientation
- Attention to process, not just outcome

*Spiritual practice precedes coding. Practice informs the work.*
