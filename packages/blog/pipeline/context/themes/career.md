# Career Arc

## Overview

Robbie's career arc must be understood through the lens of chronic illness (2009-early 2020s). What might look like "career activity" during those years was actually desperate attempts to build income while very sick. The real career pivot came with health recovery and the 2022 coding journey.

## Career Timeline

### Before 1992: American Origins

Limited information. Career/education in USA before moving to Hungary.

### 1992-2009: Hungary (Pre-Illness)

Moved to Hungary 1992-1993. Career activity during this period unknown from email archive (archive begins ~2005).

**McKinsey connection:**
- Alumni relations emails visible in later years
- Budapest alumni events
- Suggests prior McKinsey employment or partnership
- Timeframe unknown but likely pre-illness

### 2009-Early 2020s: Chronic Illness Era

**CRITICAL CONTEXT:** Robbie was severely ill with chronic illness throughout this period. All "business activity" must be understood as attempts to work *despite* debilitating health conditions.

**Business attempts (not successes):**
- Perry Marshall Mastermind Forum engagement
- Google AdWords / PPC consulting attempts
- Business entity: "Intelligent Business Solutions, Inc."

**Email volume (misleading metric):**
```
2012: 14,161 emails
2013: 18,994 emails
2014: 7,069 emails
```

**Reinterpretation:** High email volume does NOT indicate career success. It likely reflects:
- More time at computer due to illness/disability
- Desperate attempts at multiple business experiments
- Community engagement as connection during isolation
- Learning/research during periods of capacity

**The human reality:**
- Melinda likely primary earner during this period
- Business attempts may have been income supplementation
- Health limitations shaped what was possible

### 2015-2019: Continued Illness

**Email volume decline:**
```
2015: 8,560 (53% drop)
2016-2019: 5,000-8,000 range
```

**Interpretation:** Declining capacity, not business transition. May reflect:
- Worsening health
- Giving up on business attempts
- Focusing energy on survival

**Investment interest emerging:**
- Charles Schwab account activity
- Seeds of what would become Zenvestor

### Early 2020s: Recovery Phase

**Health improvement:** Chronic illness began resolving in early 2020s.

**Key developments:**
- 62 Aka Dua sessions with Viento (possibly healing-related)
- Mark Minervini webinar (Sept 2021) - stock trading interest
- Capacity returning for new learning

**Interpretation:** Health recovery created possibility for the coding journey.

### 2022: The Pivot Year

**Email volume:** 3,480 (lowest in decade)

**Key events:**
- Real estate transition (Feb 2022)
- CS50 completion - **first code ever written at age 53**
- First GitHub repos (Apr-May 2022)
- AI tool exploration (Dec 2022)

**AI tools adopted:**
- Leonardo.AI
- Rytr
- Character.AI
- Midjourney
- GPT-3 (buildspace courses)

**Interpretation:** Low email = focused learning. Health had improved enough to undertake intensive study. This was the real career pivot - from sick person attempting business to healthy person learning to code.

### 2023-2024: Framework Exploration

**GitHub evidence:**
- Multiple frameworks tried (Next.js, React, RedwoodJS, Svelte)
- Projects rebuilt multiple times (learning through iteration)
- Infrastructure investment (NixOS)
- Dart/Flutter emergence

**Pattern:** Systematic evaluation before stack selection.

### 2025-2026: AI Collaboration Era

**Current focus:**
- Zenvestor (159k LOC Dart investment app)
- aiandi (AI-human collaboration infrastructure)
- Meta-level tooling (recursive-loop, agents-init)

**Business model evolution:**
- From client services → personal products
- From marketing → software development
- From external → internal focus

| Era | Primary Skills | Context |
|-----|---------------|---------|
| Pre-1992 | Unknown | American origins |

## Business Philosophy Visible

**From illness era:**
- Persistence despite obstacles
- Self-directed learning
- Community engagement for connection
- Systematic approach (when capacity allowed)

**Applied to coding:**
- TDD (test-first)
- Clean Architecture
- ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
- Foundation-first methodology

**The deeper continuity:** The systematic approach may derive from McKinsey background (if confirmed) or from decades of self-directed learning during illness.
