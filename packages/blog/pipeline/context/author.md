## Coding Journey

### Origin (2022)

- **Age 53:** Completed Harvard's CS50 - first code ever written
- **No prior programming experience** before 2022
- GitHub account created 2015 (dormant, for Project Euler puzzles)
- True journey began post-CS50

### Timeline

| Year | Phase | Characteristics |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| 2022 | Post-CS50 Practice | CSS, Python fundamentals |
| 2023 Q1-Q2 | Framework Exploration | Next.js, React, RedwoodJS |
| 2023 Q3-Q4 | Svelte Era | Consolidation, iteration (5th-avegallery rebuilt 3x) |
| 2024 | Infrastructure | NixOS, tooling, Dart emergence |
| 2025 H1 | Investment Domain | Python architecture practice, Dart crystallization |
| 2025 H2 | AI-Augmented | Meta-level collaboration tools explosion |

### Technology Progression

```
CSS/Python (2022) → JS/TS (2023) → Svelte (2023) → Nix/Dart (2024) → Dart/Shell (2025)
```

**Framework journey:** Next.js → React → RedwoodJS → Svelte → Flutter/Serverpod

**Current stack:**
- Frontend: Flutter (Dart)
- Backend: Serverpod (Dart)
- Infrastructure: Shell, Claude Code plugins
- Knowledge: Obsidian + OpenCode

- **Scope:** Personal use → family use

### aiandi

- **Purpose:** Infrastructure for AI-human collaboration
- **Components:** CLI (Rust), MCP servers, blog
- **Philosophy:** "Sessions observe themselves, knowledge persists"

### eterne

- **Purpose:** Second brain operations (GTD + Zettelkasten)
- **Scale:** 515+ markdown notes
- **Method:** PARA (Projects/Areas/Resources/Archives)

---

## GitHub Metrics

- **Total repositories:** 29 public
- **Active:** 17
- **Archived:** 12
- **Past year contributions:** ~3,000
- **Commit pattern:** Consistent, quality-focused (atomic commits)

## Philosophy & Patterns

### Foundation First

Visible across all projects:
- Write tests before features
- Refactor as understanding deepens
- Don't skip fundamentals
- "Overkill" architecture for learning (stockbook: Clean Architecture, DDD, TDD for "simple" tracker)

### Learning Through Iteration

- 5th-avegallery rebuilt 3 times
- stockbook (Python) → zenvestor (Dart): 2 days between repos
- Framework hopping was systematic evaluation, not indecision

### Buddhist Thread

- bardotown (Bardo = intermediate state)
- dharma-dimensions (Buddhist-themed game)
- Session closing rituals with mantras
- "All phenomena is illusion"

### Meta-Level Work

2025 H2 shift: building systems for building with AI
- agents-init (scaffolding for AI projects)
- recursive-loop (plugin system)
- second-brain-gtd (productivity system)
- aiandi (blog about the journey)

## Voice Characteristics

See `voice` skill for full details. Key traits:
- Self-deprecating but not insecure
- Technical precision without jargon
- Buddhist perspective woven naturally
- "Foundation first" as lived philosophy
- Authentic beginner perspective (not false modesty)

## Key Claims (Verifiable)

| Claim | Evidence | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| "55-year-old beginner" | CS50 at 53, now 56 | Accurate (round to 55 for article) |
| "150k lines" (Zenvestor) | 159k LOC actual | Accurate |
| "Building with AI collaboration" | OpenCode integration, MCP servers | Verified |
| "Foundation first" | stockbook architecture, TDD patterns | Verified |

## Pre-Coding Life Context

**Chronic illness (2009-early 2020s):**
- Severely ill throughout this period
- Business attempts (Perry Marshall, AdWords) were done *while sick*
- High email volume ≠ career success; reflects attempts despite illness
- Health began improving in early 2020s

**Spiritual foundation:**
- Decades of practice before coding began
- 62 Aka Dua sessions with teacher Viento (2020-2021) - possibly healing-related
- Shuar ceremony organization (2009)
- Buddhist practice (Szakja Tasi Csöling)

**The 2022 pivot (post-recovery):**
- Health improved enough to undertake intensive study
- CS50 completion - first code at age 53
- Lowest email volume in decade (focused learning)
- AI tool exploration (Dec 2022)

**The deeper story:** The coding journey became possible because of health recovery. The "55-year-old beginner" narrative includes emerging from over a decade of chronic illness.
