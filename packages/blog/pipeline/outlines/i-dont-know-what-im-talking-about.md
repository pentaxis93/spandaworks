# 56, Beginner

**One-sentence teaching:** Learning to code at 56 with AI shifts the work from syntax to architecture—and that shift can reveal you already know more than you thought.

---

## Opening Hook
- 56 years old, building investment software / knowledge systems / AI tooling
- 160k lines of production code
- Still feel like a beginner most days
- Tension: competence vs. beginner's mind (some days problem, some days the point)

## The Origin: Foundation-First as Life Philosophy
- University of Illinois: started in engineering (top school, engineers paid well, good with math)
- Tried ceramic engineering, mechanical engineering—"seemed so specific, so random"
- Soul-searching: "Why am I doing this whole college? What do I want to get out of it?"
- **The decision:** Double major in philosophy and engineering physics
- **The logic:** "Equip myself with the fundamental tools required for life in our human civilization"
  - Philosophy = application of language to difficult problems
  - Engineering physics = application of math to difficult problems
- This was foundation-first thinking before it had a name

## The Career: Designed for Transfer
- EDS: "Research systems engineer" — data modeling, business process design
- McKinsey: business problems treated as systems, engineering problem-solving approach
- **Key moment:** McKinsey wanted specialization; resisted. "I wanted to hone my generalist problem-solving skills, not build a deep spike."
- The whole career was intentionally organized so learning would transfer

## The Lost Years
- 2009 to early 2020s: chronic illness
- Years of feeling useless, unsuccessful, not earning a living
- Shame
- Part of the reason for this blog: stop hiding

## The Syntax Wall (2022-2024)
- Health recovered enough to try learning to code (CS50 at 53)
- **Specific crushing moment:** Fifth Avenue Gallery website, Next.js
  - HTML, CSS, Tailwind—manageable
  - Then: page caching. Control over caching behavior of every page. Had to use it. Performance impact visible.
  - "That is when the complexity became overwhelming"
- The pivot insight: didn't need Next.js. World heading mobile-first → need multi-platform → moved to Dart and Flutter
- Learning curve didn't flatten—it reset

## The Shift
- AI tools changed what "learning to code" means
- Early days: ChatGPT in browser, copy-pasting code back and forth
- **Turning point:** AI-assisted journaling experiment (Claude Code project)
  - Journal boring without persistent memory
  - Installed persistent memory (copy-pasting files into project knowledge)
  - Over time, it got more structured
  - Learned from experimentation what worked, what didn't
  - Recognition emerged: this is systems work. I know this.
- Syntax no longer the job; structure is the job
- Division of labor: AI handles HOW, human handles WHAT/WHY
- "I'm not writing loops. I'm designing systems."

## The Recognition: Vindication
- Felt like vindication and relief
- After years of shame → discovering competence in this wild new technology
- The comfort came from past experience: philosophy + physics, EDS, McKinsey
- "I always expected it to be applicable. That was the point."

## Why Foundation-First Still Matters
- The question now: use off-the-shelf package, or spin up custom?
- Pre-made packages don't work when "they've done things in their own foundational way"
- **Example:** The basic operating rules (first system instructions). Spent time experimenting until arriving at topologically-oriented approach. "Couldn't do that with off-the-shelf setup."
- In code: tests before features, refactor as understanding deepens, fundamentals before advanced
- Slow but doesn't collapse

## Writing Is Thinking
- Blog exists to teach me, not you
- Mr. Horton (high school physics): "If you're not writing, you're not thinking"
- Explaining exposes gaps in understanding
- Not documenting figured-out things—figuring out through writing
- Part of stopping hiding: figuring it out in public

## What This Blog Is
- Documenting the build as it happens
- Architecture decisions, AI collaboration, struggles, messy middle
- What you won't find: expert advice, best practices, polished retrospectives
- What you will find: someone figuring it out in public

## Closing
- "This is either profound or hilarious. Probably both."

## Structural Notes

**New arc:** Origin (college) → Career (designed for transfer) → Lost years (illness/shame) → Syntax wall (the attempt) → Shift (AI changes everything) → Recognition (vindication) → Foundation-first today → Writing as thinking → What to expect

**The illness section:** Brief but present. Explains the emotional weight of "vindication." Connects to "stop hiding" thread.

**Title:** "56, Beginner" — stark, counter-expectation is the whole title.
