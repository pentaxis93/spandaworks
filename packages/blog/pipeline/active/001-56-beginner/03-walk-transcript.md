## Before Code: The Foundation-First Origin

**Key insight:** Systems thinking started with choice of major at University of Illinois.

Started in engineering (top-rated school, engineers paid well, good with math). Tried ceramic engineering, mechanical engineering—but what he was learning "seemed so specific, so random."

**The soul-searching question:** "Why am I doing this whole college? What do I want to get out of it?"

**The decision:** Double major in philosophy and engineering physics.

**The logic:** "I wanted to equip myself with the fundamental tools that are required for life in our human civilization. And I thought those two tools were math and language."

- Philosophy = application of language to difficult problems
- Engineering physics = application of math to difficult problems

**Quote:** "So I guess at that time, that really shows I had this foundations first mentality in college."

## The Syntax Wall: The Specific Moment

**The project:** Early version of Fifth Avenue Gallery website (possibly first), Next.js application.

**The progression:** Getting head around HTML, CSS, Tailwind—manageable.

**The crushing moment:** Page caching. "When I realized that I had control over the caching behavior of every page, and not only I had control, but I had to use that because I started to really see the performance impact, that is when the complexity for me at that time became overwhelming."

**The pivot insight:** Realized he didn't need Next.js. The world is heading mobile-first → need multi-platform tech stack → moved to Dart and Flutter.

## The Shift: Gradual Recognition

**Context:** Tools weren't sophisticated at the start. ChatGPT in browser, copy-pasting code back and forth.

**Turning point:** AI-assisted journaling experiment set up as Claude Code project.

**The progression:**
1. Journal was boring without persistent memory
2. Installed persistent memory (copy-pasting files into project knowledge)
3. Over time, it got more structured
4. Learned from experimentation what worked, what didn't
5. After a couple months: "it was very obvious to me that the parallels between what I was doing..."

[Trail off—but meaning clear: recognized the systems-thinking parallel]

---

## The Recognition: Vindication and Relief

**The feeling:** Vindication and relief.

**The context (candid, may not use directly):**
- Years of feeling useless while sick
- Unsuccessful in work
- Not earning a living
- Shame

**The recognition:** "It did feel good to realize that I'm actually... I have a certain amount of comfort in this wild new technology, just because of my past experience."

## Beginner's Mind

[Skipped - doesn't require explanation]

## The Transfer: Always Expected It

**Key reframe:** "I always expected it to be applicable. That was the point."

The college logic was intentional: organize education and career so learning would be applicable to other things in general.

**McKinsey example:** "They wanted me to specialize at a certain point. I was very resistant to specialization. I wanted to hone my generalist problem-solving skills, not build a deep spike."

**Application to AI today:** The question has become "Should I use an off-the-shelf package, or spin up my own custom package?"

**Why foundation-first matters here:** Pre-made packages don't work because "they've done things in their own foundational way."

**Concrete example:** The basic operating rules (first system instructions). Spent a lot of time experimenting until arriving at "this topologically-oriented approach, which to me feels quite elegant." Couldn't do that with off-the-shelf setup.

## Extracted Themes

1. **Foundation-first as life philosophy** - Not just coding methodology. Originates in college major choice. Intentional.

2. **Generalist resistance to specialization** - McKinsey wanted spike, he wanted breadth. This transfers to AI approach.

3. **The specific crushing moment** - Page caching in Next.js. Concrete, vivid.

4. **Recognition through journaling project** - Not coding per se, but the meta-work of setting up AI collaboration. Structure emerged through experimentation.

5. **Vindication after shame** - Chronic illness, years of feeling useless, then discovering competence. (Use carefully—may be too personal, but explains the emotional weight.)

6. **Intentional applicability** - The transfer wasn't a surprise discovery. The whole career was designed for transfer.

## Usable Texture

**For the opening:** The college choice story grounds "foundation-first" as lifelong philosophy, not coding technique.

**For the syntax wall:** Page caching in Next.js—specific, relatable, shows the exact moment of overwhelm.

**For the shift:** The journaling project as the recognition vehicle. Meta-work, not just coding.

**For "I've been designing systems my whole life":** Now has evidence. Philosophy + engineering physics = language + math applied to difficult problems. McKinsey generalist resistance. Intentionally designed for transfer.

**For emotional resonance:** The vindication/relief of competence after years of shame. (Decide how much to reveal.)
