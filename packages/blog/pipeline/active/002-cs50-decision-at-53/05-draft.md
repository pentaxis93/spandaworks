# The CS50 Decision at 53

**Stage:** DRAFT
**Created:** 2026-01-15

When I was a kid, my best friend Justin's dad worked from home as a programmer. I'd watch him at the terminal, typing what seemed like magical invocations into a Unix system. The text scrolled by in ways I couldn't understand, but I was fascinated. He could make the computer do things just by typing these commands. It seemed amazing.

I didn't know that memory would matter. Not for another 40 years.

## The Gap

I learned to program in college. Not well, but enough. Summer job after graduation, more coding. Then life took other directions. For nearly 30 years, I didn't write a line of code.

In my mid-40s, I started using Linux. That childhood fascination came back. I loved the command line, the sense of working directly with the system. But I wasn't programming. Just maintaining systems, tinkering.

Then I got sick. More than 10 years where I couldn't focus, couldn't work. When I finally started recovering, I had to build something new. My old career was gone. I needed a foundation.

April 2022. I was 53 years old. I enrolled in Harvard's CS50.

## Why CS50

People ask why I chose a college course instead of a bootcamp or tutorials. The answer is simple: I'd been tinkering for years by then, trying things, copying code I didn't understand. All that experimenting showed me exactly what I needed. Foundations. I probably never learned them properly the first time around, decades earlier. Now I needed to do it right.

CS50 starts with C before moving to Python. That choice mattered to me. David Malan explains it this way: higher-level languages make programming comfortable by hiding the dirty work of memory management. You need to learn what's happening at the low level first, so you understand what the high-level languages are hiding from you. Because every once in a while, it makes a difference.

That philosophy resonated. Foundation-first. It's how I've approached everything in my life. When I needed to rebuild after more than a decade of illness, I needed to go back to where I'd built foundations before. College. CS50 reconnected me with who I was then, when I was creating my own foundation for my career. Now I had to create a new foundation.

## What It Enabled

The course started a habit. Not the habit of writing Python specifically, but the habit of always having a project going, writing a little code every day. By the end, the final project was open-ended: build something. I already had an idea for a website. I started building it. That became the Next.js version of Fifth Avenue Gallery, though I think I started with smaller experiments first. BloopTwing. BibleTLDR. Projects where I could practice.

Here's what I didn't understand at the time: CS50 wasn't teaching me Python. It was teaching me pattern recognition.

After CS50, I learned TypeScript when I needed it for Next.js. Not that hard. Then Dart for a different project. A lot of new concepts, took a while, but still not that hard. Now I'm building CLI tools in Rust. Learning with AI assistance makes it even easier. I can generate code and have an agent explain it line by line.

Python, TypeScript, Dart, Rust. The specific language doesn't matter. What matters is the patterns, the ways of thinking, the habits. My kids tell me all the time they're never going to use what they learned in college. I've always felt like I used all of it. Not the specifics. The patterns.

## Foundations Enable Adaptation

I'm grateful I started this at 53. Now I'm 56, and I have this opportunity to participate in the emergence of AI into the mainstream. If I hadn't built those foundations three years ago, I wouldn't be here. Age should never be a barrier to learning something new. We have a tendency to calcify as we age. Some of us do, anyway. That's something to work against.

The teaching isn't "you're not too old to learn to code." That's too simple. The teaching is this: foundations enable adaptation. When you understand patterns instead of memorizing specifics, you can move between contexts. Languages change. Technologies change. The patterns persist.

## The Circle

At 56, I sit at the command line every day, typing what probably still look like magical invocations to someone watching over my shoulder. Building tools in Rust. Working with agentic AI. Still learning. Still building. Still fascinated.

The seed Justin's dad planted took more than 30 years and a health crisis to germinate. But it grew.
