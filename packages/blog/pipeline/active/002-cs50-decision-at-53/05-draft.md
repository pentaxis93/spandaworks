# The CS50 Decision at 53

**Stage:** DRAFT
**Created:** 2026-01-14

When I was a kid, my best friend's dad was a programmer. I'd see him at his terminal, typing what seemed like magical invocations. Commands that made the computer do things. I didn't understand any of it, but I thought it was amazing. Fascinating. That someone could work like that.

Years later, I'd realize what I was seeing was probably Unix or Linux. And decades after that, I'd get to type those same invocations myself.

But the path from that childhood fascination to actually coding wasn't straight. It went through college, a programming job, decades of other work, years of illness, and finally, at 53, a choice that changed everything.

## The First Foundation

College in the late 1980s. I learned to program. Not deeply, but enough. Enough to get a summer job writing code after graduation. Enough to build what I thought at the time was a foundation for a career.

Then life happened. Hungary in 1992. Family. Other work. Programming faded to background. I maintained Linux systems for a while—that childhood fascination resurfacing in my mid-40s. Getting to type those commands I'd watched as a kid. I loved it. Loved Linux. Loved the whole thing.

But that was systems work, not programming. The gap between writing code and my mid-40s was already three decades.

## The Gap

Chronic illness hit in 2009. For more than ten years, I couldn't focus. Couldn't create. Couldn't build anything.

"For years I had really not been able to," I told the recording during my walk. That's not dramatic language. That's what it was. A decade where the capacity to focus and create just wasn't there.

Then, early 2020s, health started recovering. Slowly. Not completely—I'm still not completely well now—but enough that focus became possible again.

## Tinkering

May 2022. I created the Euler repo. Python puzzles. Algorithmic practice.

I could code again. That was something.

For nine months I did this. Poking around. Practicing. Getting my hands back into it. I could have just kept going. Building little projects, solving puzzles, teaching myself whatever seemed interesting.

But the tinkering itself revealed something. I needed foundations. Actual foundations.

It had been almost 30 years since I'd learned anything about coding. And I probably never learned the foundations properly in the first place. College programming, a summer job—those gave me enough to get by then, but not a real foundation.

## The Realization

After ten years of illness, I had to create a new foundation for my career.

And maybe—maybe I had to go back to where I created the first one.

That's what I realized on the walk. Not consciously at the time, but looking back now, that's what the choice was about. Going back to this college course wasn't just about learning Python and C. It was about reconnecting with who I was when I first built a foundation. Before the illness. When I was creating something new.

## The Choice

February 2023. Age 53.

I had options. I could keep tinkering. I could sign up for a bootcamp—"Learn React in 12 weeks. Job-ready." I could jump straight into framework tutorials.

I chose Harvard's CS50. An intro computer science course. From scratch. "Hello, World" in C.

I went backwards.

## What I Loved About It

David Malan explains in the course why you learn C before Python. It's because higher-level languages make things comfortable by hiding the messy parts. The memory management. The cleanup. The low-level details.

"We have to learn what's happening first so that we can understand what's happening and being hidden from us by the higher-level language. Because every once in a while, it makes a difference."

I appreciated that very much. Loved the whole philosophy of the course, actually.

## The Intensity

February 1-24, 2023. Twenty-four days.

Thirty-one problem sets and labs. Daily work. C, Python, SQL, HTML/CSS, Flask. From "Hello, World" to a stock trading web app.

I was 53. Still quite sick. But well enough to focus. Well enough to work daily.

That's what CS50 did first: it started the habit. Daily coding. Having a project always going.

But it did something else too. Going back to this college course format—it was a kind of healing. It took me back to my college days. Reconnected me with who I was then. When I was really creating my own foundation for my career.

Now, after more than ten years of illness, I had to create a new foundation for my career. So maybe I had to go back there, to where I did that the first time, in some way.

## What CS50 Actually Gave Me

I'm not using Python anymore.

After CS50, I built some experimental projects. BloopTwing. BibleTLDR. Then Fifth Avenue Gallery in Next.js. Learning TypeScript for that wasn't hard. Then I wanted to use Dart. That wasn't hard either—a lot of new concepts, took a while, but not hard.

Now I'm building CLI tools in Rust. Learning through AI collaboration. Generate some actually useful code, then have the agent explain it line by line. A great way to learn.

The content keeps changing. Python, TypeScript, Dart, Rust. But it doesn't matter.

What CS50 gave me wasn't Python or C. It was patterns. Ways of thinking. Habits.

Daily coding. Always having a project. Foundation-first approach—understand what's happening before you let abstractions hide it.

Those disciplines are what transferred. And they're what make learning new languages easier each time. They're what make AI-assisted learning work now.

## The Foundation That Keeps Giving

Here's what I mean about the disciplines transferring.

CS50 taught me to understand memory management in C before using Python's automatic memory handling. That discipline—understanding what's hidden—now helps me learn Rust. When the AI generates code, I can ask the right questions because I know there's always something happening beneath the surface.

The daily habit CS50 started is still going. Three years later. Different languages, different projects, different tools. But the habit holds.

Always having a project. That came from CS50 too. The final project was "build something you want to build." I already had an idea. Started building it. That pattern stuck.

These aren't techniques. They're disciplines. And disciplines don't expire when the technology changes.

## The Counterfactual

What would have happened if I'd just kept tinkering?

I'd still be solving Euler problems. Maybe I'd have built a few things. But without foundations, without understanding what's happening beneath abstractions, I'd hit walls. And I wouldn't know why.

What if I'd chosen a bootcamp instead? "Learn React in 12 weeks. Job-ready."

Maybe I'd have gotten a job faster. But frameworks change. React is already not the only answer. Jobs change. Without patterns and habits and disciplines, each shift starts from scratch.

CS50 gave me something that outlasts specific content. That's why the choice mattered.

## The Age Thing

I started at 53. I'm 56 now.

I'm so grateful I started this at 53. Now I have this wonderful opportunity to participate in the emergence of AI into the mainstream. It's an incredible opportunity.

Age isn't the barrier people think it is.

The real barrier is what I call calcification. We have a tendency to kind of calcify as we age, or some of us at least do. And I think that's something we really have to work against.

Stay flexible. Keep learning. Fight the hardening.

Someone reading this might be 45, 50, 60. Maybe you coded once—college, maybe a job. Decades ago. Life happened. Now you're thinking about coding again.

You'll tinker. You'll wonder if you need "real" training. You'll see bootcamp ads promising jobs.

Here's what I want you to understand about the choice I made:

## The Teaching

**When you need to rebuild—career, identity, capability—go back to where you built before.**

CS50 wasn't just learning for me. It was healing. The college course format reconnected me with who I was when I created my first foundation. Before the illness. When I was building something new.

You might not need CS50 specifically. But if you're rebuilding after a gap, think about where you first built. What format worked for you then. There might be something about returning to that format that helps you reconnect with who you were when you were building.

**Content doesn't matter. Patterns, habits, disciplines do.**

I'm not using Python anymore. The languages keep changing. Python, TypeScript, Dart, Rust. The frameworks keep changing. Next.js, Svelte, whatever comes next.

But the patterns hold. The habits hold. The disciplines hold.

Understanding what's hidden. Working daily. Always having a project. Foundation-first thinking.

Those transfer. And they make each new thing easier to learn.

**Foundation makes new modes of learning possible.**

The CS50 habits are what make AI-assisted learning work for me now. I can generate Rust code and understand it because I know how to ask what's being hidden. I know what questions to ask because I have foundation to build on.

Without foundation, AI assistance would be cargo-cult programming. Generate code I don't understand, hope it works, stuck when it breaks.

With foundation, AI becomes a force multiplier. Generate code, understand it deeply, modify it confidently, learn faster.

**Age isn't the barrier. Calcification is.**

Stay flexible. Fight the hardening. Keep learning.

## Where It Led

The daily habit that CS50 started is still running. Three years later.

Always having a project. Still true.

Current project: Rust CLI tools with AI assistance. The foundation from CS50 makes this possible.

That childhood fascination—seeing someone type "magical invocations" at a terminal—is now daily work. The circle complete.

But the spiral isn't closed. Still building. Still learning. Still participating in something bigger than what I started with.

## What This Story Is Really About

It's not about CS50 specifically. It's not about choosing foundations over frameworks, or bootcamps versus college courses.

It's about knowing when to return. What to bring forward. How to rebuild.

After ten years of illness, I needed to create a new foundation. I went back to where I created the first one. Not to the same content—that would be pointless. But to the same format. The same structure. The pattern of foundation-building itself.

And what transferred wasn't the languages or the frameworks. It was the disciplines. The habits. The ways of thinking.

Those are what I'm using now. Three years later. Different languages. Different tools. New modes of learning.

But the foundation holds.

If you're in a similar place—coded once, life happened, thinking about returning—you don't need to do exactly what I did. But think about this:

Where did you first build? What format worked for you? What patterns and habits and disciplines did you develop then that might transfer now?

You might be surprised what's still there, waiting to be reconnected.

And you might be surprised what becomes possible when you give yourself permission to go back to where you built before.

The content changes. The foundation remains.
