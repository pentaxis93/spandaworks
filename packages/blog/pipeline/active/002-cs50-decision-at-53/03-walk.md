## The Question

> Why did you choose to start over with CS50 instead of jumping straight to modern frameworks — when you already knew programming existed?

---

## The Gap

You programmed in college. You had a summer job coding. You ran Linux systems for years. Then... decades passed.

**What was that gap like? When did you realize how much had changed?**

---

## The Decision Point

It's 2022. You're 53. You're ready to code again.

The internet is full of options: bootcamps promising jobs in 12 weeks, YouTube tutorials, "learn React in a weekend," framework documentation.

**What made you choose a Harvard intro course instead?**

---

## What You Knew

You weren't a complete beginner — you'd written code before, even if decades ago.

**What did that old experience tell you about what you needed? What did it tell you about what you were missing?**

---

## The Experience

CS50 is famously rigorous. Problem sets. C before Python. David Malan's lectures.

**What was it actually like going through it at 53? What surprised you?**

---

## The Counterfactual

Imagine you'd chosen differently — gone straight to a React tutorial or a bootcamp.

**What do you think would have happened? What would you have missed?**

---

## The Teaching

Someone reading this might be 45, or 55, or 60. They programmed once. They're considering starting again.

**What do you want them to understand about the choice you made?**

---

## Anything Else

Walking often surfaces thoughts that don't fit the questions.

**What came up that we didn't ask about?**

*Take your time. The walk serves the thinking.*
