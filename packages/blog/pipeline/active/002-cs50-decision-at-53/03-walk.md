## The Question

> You were coding again after 30 years. Nine months in, you chose to go backwards—Harvard's CS50, starting from "Hello, World." What did that choice make possible?

---

## The 30-Year Gap

College programming. A summer job writing code. Years maintaining Linux systems. Then... decades. No active programming from the early 1990s until 2022.

**What was it like when you first thought about coding again after all those years?**

---

## April 2022: Breaking the Ice

First repo after 30 years: Albert. CSS. Then euler in May—Python puzzles.

You were back. You could have just kept going.

**What was that tinkering period like for you?**

---

## The Realization

Nine months of tinkering. Albert, euler, poking around. Then in February 2023, you started CS50—Harvard's intro course. From scratch. "Hello, World" in C.

You went backwards.

**What made you realize you needed foundations?**

---

## The Choice Point

February 2023. You had options: keep tinkering, pick a bootcamp, dive into React tutorials. You chose an intro CS course. "Hello, World" at 53.

**What were you choosing and what were you refusing?**

---

## The Intensity

February 1-24, 2023. Twenty-four days. Thirty-one problem sets and labs. Daily work. C, Python, SQL, HTML/CSS, Flask. From "Hello, World" to a stock trading web app.

You're 53. That's a sprint.

**What was that intensity like for you?**

---

## Health & Timing

The timeline shows chronic illness from 2009 to early 2020s. Health recovery in early 2020s. Then tinkering in 2022. Then the CS50 sprint in early 2023—24 days, 31 problem sets.

**How did health recovery make this possible?**

---

## The Counterfactual: Just Keep Tinkering

You'd already broken the ice. Albert worked. Euler worked. You were coding again.

**What would have happened if you'd just kept building?**

---

## The Counterfactual: Bootcamp

"Learn React in 12 weeks. Job-ready." That's the promise. Fast track to frameworks.

**If you'd chosen a bootcamp, where would you be now?**

---

## What CS50 Actually Gave You

After CS50: blooptwang (Next.js chatbot), framework exploration, Svelte, Dart. Then stockbook with Clean Architecture. Then Zenvestor—159,000 lines, full CI/CD, ADRs from the start.

The foundation-first pattern shows up everywhere.

**When did you realize CS50 had changed how you build?**

---

## Prior Experience as Context

You weren't a complete beginner. You'd coded in college, had a programming job, ran Linux systems for years. Decades removed, but not zero.

**How did that prior experience inform the choice?**

---

## The Teaching

Someone reading this is 45, 50, 60. They coded once—college, maybe a job. Decades ago. Life happened. Now they're thinking about coding again.

They'll tinker. They'll wonder if they need "real" training. They'll see bootcamp ads.

**What do you want them to understand about your choice?**

---

## What Else?

Walking surfaces thoughts that don't fit in boxes.

**What came up that these questions didn't ask about?**

---

*Take your time. Walk as long as you need. The insight will come.*
