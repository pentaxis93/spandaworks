## One-Sentence Teaching

You don't need to have been "building computers in your garage at 12" — you can return to programming at 53 with Harvard's intro course and actually get somewhere.

---

## Why It Matters

Directly challenges "too old to learn to code" narrative. Sets up credibility baseline for all subsequent articles — without it, readers assume prior background.

---

## The Core Question

Why did someone who *already knew* programming existed choose to start from scratch with CS50 instead of jumping to tutorials or bootcamps?

---

## Key Context

- Prior programming experience (college + summer job after college)
- Years of Linux systems experience  
- Decades-long gap with no active programming
- At 53, chose CS50 as the deliberate re-entry point
- Foundation-first philosophy visible across all subsequent work

---

## What to Explore (Walk Topics)

- What the gap was like
- Why CS50 specifically (not bootcamp, not tutorial hell)
- What old experience told you about what you needed
- What CS50 was actually like at 53
- What would have happened if you'd chosen differently
- What readers in similar situations should understand

## Gate Question

Can you state the teaching in one sentence?

**Answer:** Yes — see above.

**Gate:** PASSED
